## Application Highlights

### Data Preparation

- The dataset includes a variety of attractions in Sofia with fields such as name, description, category, operating hours, and GPS coordinates.
- A unique hash (`Key`) is generated for each attraction using the `digest` package.

### UI

- **Dynamic Filtering**: Filter attractions by category or search by name.
- **Responsive Cards**: Each attraction is displayed as a card with a status (open/closed), an image, and a favorite icon.
- **Favorites Management**: Favorites are stored in the browser using `localStorage`.

### Server Logic

- **Status Updates**: Attraction status (open/closed) is updated in real-time based on the current hour.
- **Map Integration**: Attractions are plotted on a Leaflet map with interactive popups.
- **Details Modal**: Detailed information about each attraction is displayed in a modal dialog.

## Future Enhancements

- **Language Options**: Add support for multiple languages (e.g., English).
- **Advanced Filters**: Include options to filter by distance, ratings, or opening hours.
- **User Accounts**: Enable user authentication for saving favorites across devices.
- **Event Integration**: Add information about events near attractions.
